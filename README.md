FixiT AI Demo

This repository contains a simple front-end demo website for FixiT AI, an AI-powered platform concept designed to help users repair their belongings, learn about technology, and understand their consumer rights.

This demo was created as part of an assignment to illustrate the basic structure and user interface of the proposed web application.
Features Demonstrated

    Two Interconnected Pages:

        index.html: A landing page highlighting the features, pricing plans, and a contributor option.

        ai_interface.html: A basic interface simulating the AI chat and real-time visual assistance feature.

    Material 3 Inspired UI: Styling based on Material Design 3 principles using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive look.

    Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).

    Basic Chat Interface Placeholder: A functional (but simulated) chat area on the AI interface page.

    Camera Button Placeholder: A button on the AI interface page representing the planned real-time visual assistance feature (functionality is simulated with an alert).

    Navigation: Links between the landing page and the AI interface page are functional.
